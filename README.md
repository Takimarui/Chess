# ♟ Chess (Educational Project in Unity)

This project was created as an **educational exercise** after studying object-oriented programming concepts. The goal was to apply what I learned by building a full-featured multiplayer chess game using **Unity** and **Photon Networking**.

Although it's an educational project, the game includes all core chess mechanics, online multiplayer, sound effects, music, and a playable interface.

## 📌 Notes

This project was created entirely from scratch as an **educational game** to reinforce programming principles, particularly OOP and client-server communication. All chess logic was written manually without using external logic libraries or pre-built game templates.

While it's primarily a learning project, the game is fully playable online and can be shared with friends or tested for fun.
