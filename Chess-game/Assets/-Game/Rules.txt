### **Chess Rules**

Chess is a strategy board game in which two players (White and Black) control armies of 16 pieces, aiming to checkmate the opponent’s king.

------

## **1. Piece Setup**

The chessboard consists of **64 squares** (8×8), each with coordinates (e.g., e4).

- White starts on **the 1st and 2nd ranks**.
- Black starts on **the 7th and 8th ranks**.

**Piece Placement (from a1 to h1 for White, a8 to h8 for Black):**

- **Rooks (R)** on a1, h1 (a8, h8).
- **Knights (N)** on b1, g1 (b8, g8).
- **Bishops (B)** on c1, f1 (c8, f8).
- **Queen (Q)** on d1 (d8). **The queen stands on her color** (White on a white square, Black on a black square).
- **King (K)** on e1 (e8).
- **Pawns (P)** fill the 2nd and 7th ranks.

------

## **2. How Pieces Move**

### **2.1. Pawn (P)**

- Moves **1 square forward** (or 2 squares forward from its starting position).
- Captures **diagonally** by moving 1 square forward.
- Special move: **En passant** – if a pawn moves 2 squares forward and lands beside an opponent’s pawn, the opponent can capture it as if it moved only 1 square forward.
- Reaching the last rank allows **promotion** to any piece (except the king).

### **2.2. Rook (R)**

- Moves **vertically or horizontally** any number of squares.
- Cannot jump over pieces.

### **2.3. Knight (N)**

- Moves in an **"L" shape** (2 squares in one direction, then 1 square perpendicular).
- **The only piece** that can **jump over** others.

### **2.4. Bishop (B)**

- Moves **diagonally** any number of squares.
- **Cannot jump over** pieces.
- One bishop stays on **light squares**, the other on **dark squares**.

### **2.5. Queen (Q)**

- Moves **like a rook and a bishop combined** (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).
- The most powerful piece on the board.

### **2.6. King (K)**

- Moves **1 square in any direction**.
- **Castling** – a special move with the rook (explained below).

## **3. Special Rules**

### **3.1. Check**

- When the king is attacked, it is in **check**.
- The player must escape check by:
  1. Moving the king.
  2. Blocking with another piece.
  3. Capturing the attacking piece.

### **3.2. Checkmate**

- If check **cannot be escaped**, it is **checkmate** – the game ends.

### **3.3. Stalemate**

- If a player has **no legal moves**, but their king is **not in check**, it is **stalemate** – a draw.

### **3.4. Castling**

- The king and rook swap places under these conditions:
  - Neither the king nor the rook **has moved before**.
  - There are **no pieces between them**.
  - The king **is not in check** and **does not pass through an attacked square**.
- Types of castling:
  - **Kingside castling** – the king moves 2 squares to the right, and the rook moves to its left side.
  - **Queenside castling** – the king moves 2 squares to the left, and the rook moves to its right side.

### **3.5. En Passant**

- If a pawn moves **2 squares forward**, and an opponent’s pawn is beside it, the opponent can **capture it** as if it had moved only 1 square.

### **3.6. Pawn Promotion**

- A pawn that reaches **the last rank** can be **promoted** to any piece except the king (usually a queen).

------

## **4. How the Game Ends**

### **4.1. Victory**

- **Checkmate** – if the opponent’s king is trapped.
- **Resignation** – a player can surrender at any time.
- **Time runs out** – in timed games, a player loses if their clock reaches zero.

### **4.2. Draw**

- **Stalemate** – no legal moves, but the king is **not in check**.
- **Threefold repetition** – the same position occurs **three times**.
- **50-move rule** – if **no captures or pawn moves** occur in **50 moves**, the game is drawn.
- **Insufficient material** – if neither player has **enough pieces to checkmate** (e.g., king vs. king and knight).

------

### **5. Who Moves First?**

- **White always moves first**.
- Players take turns after that.
